# SplitFocusGamePrototype
This is a prototype for a little game I've been working on. Use WASD to move the character around and space to fire magic bolts to kill enemies. At the same time, use the arrow keys to dodge projectiles in the small minigame on the right hand side of the screen. Dodging effectively in the minigame will give you more powerful magic bolts!
